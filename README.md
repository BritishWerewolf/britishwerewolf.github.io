# British Werewolf Personal Site
It's true, I don't have a domain or hosting, I figured this repo would be enough.  
And you know what? It is!

## Can I clone it?
Sure.  
Though, I don't know why you'd want to.

I have plans to make this a better static site generation (SSG) process, but in the mean time it's just a few HTML files with Pico CSS as a CSS framework.

## There's a typo!
I sure hope not, but if there is, just let me know! ðŸ™‚
