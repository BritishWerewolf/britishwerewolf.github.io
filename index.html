                <b>How I made a CLI tool in Rust for my blog</b>

                <p>Today I released <a href="https://crates.io/crates/blogs-md-easy">blogs-md-easy</a>.<br>A simple CLI that takes your Markdown files, and populates a predefined HTML template with the content.</p>
                <p>If I use the same template every time, it might seem easier to just copy and paste that template and edit the content.</p>
                <p>Perhaps.</p>
                <p>It's much easier to write in a simple text format, and then copy that into HTML when I come to publish.</p>

                <b>Why Pico CSS might be my favourite framework</b>
                <small>Published on 2024-02-19</small>

            <div>
                <p>This week the Pico team released version 2 of their lightweight, (almost) classless CSS framework.</p>
                <b>What is Pico CSS?</b>
                <p>In a world of pre built components, or utility class frameworks, Pico was a breath of fresh air.</p>
                <p>Pico has just a handful of classes (unless you opt for the classless version!), but is built on the premise that you write semantic HTML and the rest is handled for you.</p>

                <p>I built this tool especially for this site. Instead of manually copying an old blog and editing it, this allows me to write Markdown and convert it to HTML.</p>
                <p>I'm proud of this one! It's my first ever published package!</p>

            <div>
                <p>This was the first application I ever wrote in Rust. I opted to use the <a href="https://yew.rs">Yew</a> framework.</p>
                <p>It's a relatively simple application - okay, it's <i>really</i> simple - but it does demonstrate passing data into props.</p>

            <div>
                <p>My second Rust app was again using the Yew framework, but this time I added a few more dependecies as I was feeling more confident with framework.</p>
                <p>This now utilised hooks for state, as well as a custom Store. Again, as I was still learning, I chose to implement my own store rather than a premade one.</p>
                <p>I was quite proud of this project!</p>

                <p>I wanted to create a fluid way of generating alerts using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap CSS</a>. By passing in a single object as the argument it's possible to set settings like <code>{ dismissible: true, background: "success" }</code>.</p>
