            <h1>Why Pico CSS might be my favourite framework</h1>
            <p>This week the Pico team released version 2 of their lightweight, (almost) classless CSS framework.</p>

            <h2>What is Pico CSS?</h2>
            <p>In a world of pre built components, or utility class frameworks, Pico was a breath of fresh air.</p>
            <p>Pico has just a handful of classes (unless you opt for the classless version!), but is built on the premise that you write semantic HTML and the rest is handled for you.</p>
            <p>Rather than styling based on IDs or classes, Pico applies styles to the elements themselves.</p>
            <p>It's this philosophy that is the reason I chose it for my personal blog site here.</p>
            <p>No need to worry about which class to use, just write the HTML and that's it - a focus purely on content.</p>

            <h2>Who's Pico for?</h2>
            <p>As you can tell, the limited customisations will be a huge negative for most people, but it's not a complete write off.</p>
            <p>I chose Pico because of its focus on content.</p>
            <p>Out the box, Pico makes all elements responsive and comes with dark mode!</p>
            <p>Seriously!</p>
            <p>Right away I was able to just start writing content and have it styled effectively; the only learning comes for things like <a href="https://picocss.com/docs/card">cards</a> knowing that they are the <code>article</code> tag, and can have accompanying <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> elements.</p>
            <p>The docs are so short, you could read them cover to cover in 30 mins.</p>

            <h2>So, what's new?</h2>
            <p>Truthfully, not much.</p>
            <p>If you were using version 1, the upgrade process was as simple as swapping the minified CSS to version 2.</p>
            <p>In my case, I also had to update my CSS vars to be prefaced with <code>pico-</code>.</p>
            <p>Additionally there is a new component to group elements for horizontal stacking, overflow auto support, conditional styling if you want to use Pico in combination with another framework and only style certain elements, a suite of new colour classes, and finally some breaking changes to things like button widths and accordions drop downs.</p>

            <h2>But why do <em>you</em> love it?</h2>
            <p>It's true, a framework this light on features feels like it shouldn't even be considered in this modern world of feature rich, “does it all” frameworks; I honestly think we've lost touch a little bit.</p>
            <p>It's sad to see that many devs - junior or senior, new or seasoned - will reach for a framework <em>from the start</em>, regardless of the project scope or requirements.</p>
            <p>Don't get me wrong, PurgeCSS is great, and Tailwind benefits hugely from it, but we don't always have to reach for these tools.</p>
            <p>When I started this site, I knew it would be static and I didn't really want to worry about any build steps if I could help it, so I just started writing CSS; and this worked fine.</p>
            <p>My instinct was to set up Tailwind, it is probably my favourite framework and I am very familiar with it.</p>
            <p>However, I had heard of Pico and thought it might save me some time and give my site some consistency, so I set it up.</p>
            <p>I'm glad I did.</p>
            <p>Even with Tailwind I have to think about the styles I need, but with Pico I don't have to ever think of the CSS, just type out my HTML and have the site styled as I go.</p>
            <p>Perfect!</p>

            <h2>So, we should all use Pico now?</h2>
            <p>Of course not.</p>
            <p>If that's the message that I've delivered, then I've failed with this article.</p>
            <p>If I could pick two frameworks, they'd be: Pico and Tailwind.</p>
            <p>And I'd probably start every project as a Pico project.</p>
            <p>Pico is too lightweight at scale, and doesn't allow for complex views using something like CSS grid for instance.</p>
            <p>In these cases I'd probably switch over to Tailwind and use its utility classes going forward.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>I hope you at least read the Pico docs and let me know your opinions.</p>
            <p>And if you are impressed by it, I'd love to see what you made!</p>
            <p>I'm in no way affiliated with Pico, but if you want to reach me and show me what you think or made, I'm usually quite active on <a href="https://twitter.com/BritWerewolf">Twitter</a>.</p>
